    "I used to work on large international projects as an automation engineer, which brought me close to software development and sparked my interest on coding. This interest eventually led to my second degree and to a change of field.\n\nAs a software developer I'm especially interested in producing quality code with high test coverage. The technologies shown below are the ones I use almost daily. Besides them I'm mainly focused on software architecture, development of component libraries, UI/UX-design and E2E testing frameworks.",
