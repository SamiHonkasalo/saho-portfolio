This interest eventually led to my second degree and to a change of field.\n\nAs a software developer I'm especially interested in producing quality code with high test coverage. The technologies shown below are the ones I use almost daily. Besides them I'm mainly focused on software architecture, development of component libraries, UI/UX-design and E2E testing frameworks."
